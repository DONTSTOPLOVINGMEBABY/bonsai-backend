/// <reference types="../types/express.d.ts" />

Problems that I found tentative solutions for, but are still likely to have better implementations/ways of solving them 

1. Not being able to merge custom express types into express, etc. 

2. Environment variable loading? Should I extend the process.env interface to 
allow for all of my environment variables and then only call validate in top-level main function? 

3. How do I actually test my application and its endpoints in a contained environment?
    - Compose file may be wise choice
